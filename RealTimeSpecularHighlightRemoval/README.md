# Real-Time High-Quality Specular Highlight Removal Using Efficient Pixel Clustering

by Antonio Souza, Márcio Macedo, Verônica Nascimento and Bruno Oliveira.

### Introduction

This is a C++/OpenCV/CUDA application for real-time specular highlight removal in still images. Technical details are provided in our [SIBGRAPI 2018 paper.](https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2018.00014) 

To enable real-time specular highlight removal using GPU, uncomment the line #define USE_CUDA in include/Removal/useCUDA.h.
